        My research focuses on understanding cognitive aging through the lens of cognitive reserve, social determinants, and neuroimaging biomarkers. I am particularly interested in how these factors interact to influence cognitive function and decline in older adults.

        My work combines longitudinal data analysis, neuroimaging techniques, and epidemiological methods to investigate the mechanisms underlying cognitive resilience in aging populations. I am passionate about translating research findings into practical interventions that can improve the health and well-being of older adults.
