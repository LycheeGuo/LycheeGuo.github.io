abstract: "Background: Hearing loss (HL) is one major cause of disability and
  can lead to social impairments. However, the relationship between loneliness
  and the risk of incident HL remains unclear. Our study aimed to investigate
  this association among adults in the UK. Methods: This cohort study was based
  on data from the UK Biobank study. Loneliness was assessed by asking
  participants if they often felt lonely. Incident HL was defined as a primary
  diagnosis, ascertained via linkage to electronic health records. Cox
  proportional hazard regression models were used to examine the association
  between loneliness and risk of incident HL. Results: Our analyses included
  490,865 participants [mean (SD) age, 56.5 (8.1) years; 54.4% female], among
  whom 90,893 (18.5%) reported feeling lonely at baseline. Over a median
  follow-up period of 12.3 years (interquartile range, 11.3 to 13.1), 11,596
  participants were diagnosed with incident HL. Compared to non-lonely
  participants, lonely individuals exhibited an increased risk of HL [hazard
  ratio (HR), 1.36; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.30 to 1.43]. This
  association remained (HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.17 to 1.31) after adjusting for
  potential confounders, including age, sex, socioeconomic status, biological
  and lifestyle factors, social isolation, depression, chronic diseases, use of
  ototoxic drugs, and genetic risk of HL. The joint analysis showed that
  loneliness was significantly associated with an increased risk of incident HL
  across all levels of genetic risks for HL. Conclusions: Loneliness was
  associated with the risk of incident HL independent of other prominent risk
  factors. Social enhancement strategies aimed at alleviating loneliness may
  prove beneficial in HL prevention."
