As the global population ages, understanding the psychosocial determinants of health has become a critical priority. A fundamental challenge in this field is distinguishing between social isolation and loneliness. Isolation is an objective metric, characterized by the absence of social contact and a reduced social network size. In contrast, loneliness is a subjective evaluation, reflecting an individual’s personal dissatisfaction with the frequency or emotional depth of their relationships. Research indicates that these two factors are only weakly correlated; socially connected individuals can still experience profound loneliness, while objectively isolated individuals may be satisfied with their solitude. Consequently, isolation and loneliness likely influence mortality and morbidity through distinct biological pathways.

To address this complexity, this project employs a multi-dimensional analytical framework. By integrating public health data, advanced neuroimaging analysis, and biomarker assessment, we aim to investigate the objective and subjective dimensions of social relationships simultaneously. This approach allows us to go beyond simple behavioral observations and explore the underlying physiological mechanisms—such as structural brain changes or inflammatory markers—that link social deficits to physical decline. By disentangling how isolation and loneliness independently and interactively affect health, this study will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the aging process and inform more targeted interventions for older adults.
