Lizhi is a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Psychology at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, supervised by [Prof. Helene H. Fung](https://cumotivationandemotion.psy.cuhk.edu.hk/blog/) and [Prof. Hanna Lu](https://www.psychiatry.cuhk.edu.hk/members/dr-hanna-lu/). He  also serves as a Visiting PhD Student at King’s College London under the guidance of [Prof. Dag Aarsland](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/dag-aarsland). Lizhi’s research primarily focuses on the moderating effect of Cognitive Reserve on cognitive aging. He utilizes multi-modal data—including neuroimaging and fluid biomarkers—to investigate the resilience mechanisms that allow individuals to maintain cognitive function despite neuropathology. Prior to his doctoral studies, Lizhi worked as a Research Assistant at the Shenzhen Bay Laboratory, where he gained extensive experience in multi-modal data collection, including neuroimaging, blood biomarkers, and neuropsychological assessments. He holds a Master’s degree in Applied Psychology from Tianjin University, where his thesis on the association between social isolation, loneliness and cognition was recognized as an Outstanding Thesis. His work has been published in leading peer-reviewed journals, including *Alzheimer’s & Dementia*, *Alzheimer’s Research & Therapy*, *Neurobiology of Aging*, *Age and Ageing*, and *Archives of Gerontology and Geriatrics*. He also serves as a reviewer for several high-impact journals, such as *Alzheimer’s & Dementia*, *Age and Ageing*, and *Depression and Anxiety*.
