# Hi there, I'm Lizhi Guo 👋

### Ph.D. Candidate in Psychology @ CUHK

I am a Ph.D. candidate at **The Chinese University of Hong Kong**, supervised by Prof. Helene H. Fung and Prof. Hanna Lu. I am also an incoming Visiting PhD Student at **King’s College London** (Feb 2026) under the guidance of Prof. Dag Aarsland.

My research primarily focuses on **the moderating effect of Cognitive Reserve on cognitive aging**. I utilize multi-modal data—including neuroimaging and fluid biomarkers—to investigate the resilience mechanisms that allow individuals to maintain cognitive function despite neuropathology.

Prior to my doctoral studies, I worked as a Research Assistant at the **Shenzhen Bay Laboratory**, gaining extensive experience in collecting and analyzing neuroimaging, blood biomarkers, and neuropsychological data. I hold a Master’s degree in Applied Psychology from **Tianjin University**, where my thesis on the association between social isolation, loneliness, and cognition was recognized as an Outstanding Thesis.
